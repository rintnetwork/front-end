  "rint-page-dapps-features-1-description": "Once deployed to Rint Network, dapp code can’t be taken down. And anyone can use the dapp’s features. Even if the team behind the dapp disbanded you could still use it. Once on Rint Network, it stays there.",
  "rint-page-dapps-features-1-title": "No owners",
  "rint-page-dapps-features-2-description": "You can't be blocked from using a dapp or submitting transactions. For example, if Twitter was on Rint Network, no one could block your account or stop you from tweeting.",

  "rint-page-dapps-features-4-description": "Dapp code is often in the open and compatible by default. Teams regularly build using other teams' work. If you want to let users swap tokens in your dapp, you can just plug in another dapp's code.",

  "rint-page-dapps-features-5-description": "With most dapps, you don't need to share your real-world identity. Your Rint Network account is your login and you just need a wallet.",

  "rint-page-dapps-hero-subtitle": "Dapps are a growing movement of applications that use Rint Network to disrupt business models or invent new ones.",
  "rint-page-dapps-how-dapps-work-p1": "Dapps have their backend code (smart contracts) running on a decentralized network and not a centralized server. They use the Binance Smart Chain for data storage and smart contracts for their app logic.",
  "rint-page-dapps-how-dapps-work-p2": "A smart contract is like a set of rules that live on-chain for all to see and run exactly according to those rules. Imagine a vending machine: if you supply it with enough funds and the right selection, you'll get the item you want. And like vending machines, smart contracts can hold funds much like your Rint Network account. This allows code to mediate agreements and transactions.",
  "rint-page-dapps-how-dapps-work-p3": "Once dapps are deployed on the Rint Network you can't change them. Dapps can be decentralized because they are controlled by the logic written into the contract, not an individual or a company.",
