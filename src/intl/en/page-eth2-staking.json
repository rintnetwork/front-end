  "page-rnt-staking-51-desc-1": "Staking makes joining the network as a validator more accessible so it’s likely that there’ll be more validators in the network than exists today. This will make this kind of attack even harder as the cost of an attack will increase.",
  "reyna-page-rnt-staking-accessibility": "More accessible",
  "reyna-page-rnt-staking-accessibility-desc": "With easier hardware requirements and the opportunity to pool if you don’t have 100M RNT, more people will be able to join the network. This will make Reyna Network more decentralized and secure by decreasing the attack surface area.",
  "reyna-page-rnt-staking-at-stake": "Your RNT is at Farming",
  "reyna-page-rnt-staking-at-stake-desc": "Reyna Network has a liquidity farming program. This means that if you carry out activity on the platform, you will receive a reward in RNT tokens. The main reward is the accrual of RNT tokens to all liquidity providers. The user provides liquidity in the Reyna Network liquidity pools, and in return receives LP tokens (liquidity tokens). The user can place these tokens in the farming smart contract and will receive rewards in RNT tokens. ",

  "reyna-page-rnt-staking-deposit-address-desc": "If you’ve already followed the setup instructions on the launchpad, you’ll know you need to send a transaction to the staking deposit contract. We recommend you check the address very carefully. You can find the official address on reyna.network and a number of other trusted sites.",
  "reyna-page-rnt-staking-desc-1": "Rewards are given for actions that help the network reach consensus. You'll get rewards for batching transactions into a new block or checking the work of other validators because that's what keeps the chain running securely.",
  "reyna-page-rnt-staking-desc-2": "Although you can earn rewards for doing work that benefits the network, you can lose RNT for malicious actions, going offline, and failing to validate.",
  "reyna-page-rnt-staking-desc-3": "You'll need 100M RNT to become a full validator or some RNT to join a staking pool. The launchpad will walk you through the process and hardware requirements. Alternatively, you can use a backend API.",
  "reyna-page-rnt-staking-description": "Staking is the act of depositing 100M RNT to activate validator software. As a validator you’ll be responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new solutions to the ecosystem. This will keep Reyna Network secure for everyone and earn you new RNT in the process. This process, known as proof-of-stake, is being introduced by Binance Smart Chain.",

  "reyna-page-rnt-staking-pos-explained": "Proof-of-stake explained",
  "reyna-page-rnt-staking-pos-explained-desc": "Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism where block validators are selected based on the number of coins they are staking. In this case, the term staking refers to the act of validators committing funds to the system. So validators can only participate in the process of producing new blocks if they lock their coins.",
  "reyna-page-rnt-staking-pos-explained-desc-1": "The locked funds will then act as collateral, meaning that malicious validators will most likely lose their stake and be kicked out of the network. On the other hand, honest validators will be rewarded as new blocks are produced (forged). Thus, we may say that a PoS blockchain achieves distributed consensus according to the economic stake that validators commit to the network.",

  "reyna-page-rnt-staking-sharding": "Unlocks sharding",
  "reyna-page-rnt-staking-sharding-desc": "Sharding is only possible with a proof-of-stake system. Sharding a proof-of-work system would dilute the amount of computing power needed to corrupt the network, making it easier for malicious miners to control shards. This isn’t the case with randomly-assigned stakers in proof of stake.",
