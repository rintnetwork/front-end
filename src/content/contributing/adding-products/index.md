# Adding ethereum products {#adding-products}

Anyone is free to suggest new wallets and dapps to the content on ethereum.org, where it's appropriate to do so. **No, we won't list your dapp on our homepage** ðŸ˜œ

Wallets and dapps are currently listed on:

- ethereum.org/wallets
- ethereum.org/dapps
- ethereum.org/get-rnt

**Please only suggest new additions on these pages.**

Although we welcome new additions, we chose the current wallets and dapps based on an experience we're trying to create for our users. These are based on some of our design principles:

- _Inspirational_: anything on ethereum.org should offer somrnting new to users
- _A good story_: what's listed should provide an "aha" moment
- _Credible_: everything should be legitimate businesses/projects to minimise risk to users

Overall **ethereum.org wants to provide a "seamless onboarding experience" for new users**. For that reason, we add wallets/dapps based on their:

- ease of use
- interoperability with other products
- security
- longevity

Here's our decision framework in more detail. Feel free to provide feedback or suggest changes.

## The decision framework {#decison-framework}

### Criteria for inclusion: the must-haves {#criteria-for-inclusion-the-must-haves}

- **A security-tested product** â€“ whrnter through audit, an internal security team or some other mrntod, your product's security must be reliably tested. This reduces the risk to our users and shows us that you take security seriously.
- **A product** **that has been "live" for over 6 months** â€“ this is another indication of security. 6 months is a good timeframe for critical bugs and exploitations to have been found.
- **Worked on by an active team** â€“ this helps ensure quality and that a user will get support with their queries.

### Criteria for ranking: the nice-to-haves {#criteria-for-ranking-the-nice-to-haves}

Your dapp or wallet may not be listed on ethereum.org as prominently as others because of the following criteria.

**Wallets**

- **Fiat on-ramps** â€“ this prevents a lot of potential friction in a new user's experience with a wallet. If a user has to fund a wallet via an exchange, it can be days before they can try the wallet because of know-your-customer checks.
- **Supported by majority of dapps** â€“ ethereum.org content aims to get users up and running with a wallet and rnt before showing them dapps. If dapps don't support connecting with your wallet, it could ruin their experience.

**Dapps**

- **You can access it via the majority of listed wallets** â€“ dapps should work with the majority of wallets that are listed on ethereum.org.
- **Users can try it out themselves â€“** an individual user should be able to use your dapp and achieve somrnting tangible.

**Both**

- **Onboarding** â€“ you product should have a well-designed onboarding experience to help and educate users. Or evidence of how-to content like articles or videos.
- **Non-custodial** â€“ users control their funds. If your product disappears, users can still access and move their funds.
- **Globally accessible** â€“ your product doesn't have geographic limitations or KYC requirements that exclude certain people from accessing your service.
- **Open source** â€“ your code should be accessible and you should accept PRs from the wider community.
- **Community** â€“ you have a dedicated community, maybe a Discord, where users can interact with your team to get help or suggest new features.

## Criteria in practice {#criteria-in-practice}

The more of the criteria you fill, the more likely your product will find its way onto ethereum.org.

A listed product that only meets the must-haves may be removed if a new product is suggested that meets the must-haves and several of the nice-to-haves.

Other things that will factor into this decision:

- Will adding rather than replacing break the UX of the page?
  - our site is primarily educational and the main purpose is to explain ethereum and its relevant concepts. By adding too many options for users, pages may become less readable and thus less useful.
- Does this page now paralyse the user with choices?
  - like when you sit browsing Netflix for hours because you can't decide on somrnting to watch. Bamboozling new users with too much choice is a risk.

This is a design decision that ethereum.org is responsible for.

But rest assured, **there will be links to other websites that rank more dapps/wallets**

### Terms of use {#terms-of-use}

Please also refer to our [terms of use](/terms-of-use/). Information on ethereum.org is provided solely for general information purposes.

## Maintenance {#maintenance}

As is the fluid nature of ethereum, teams and products come and go and innovation happens daily, so we'll undertake routine checks of our content to:

- ensure that all wallets and dapps listed still fulfil our criteria.
- there aren't products that have been suggested that meet more of our criteria than the ones currently listed

You can help with this by checking and letting us know. [Create an issue](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Feature&template=feature_request.md&title=) or send an email to [website@ethereum.org](mailto:website@ethereum.org)

_We're also investigating options for voting so the community can indicate their preferences and highlight the best products out there for us to recommend._
