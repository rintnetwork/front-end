# Reyna Network Whitepaper {#reyna-whitepaper}

_This introductory paper was originally published in 2021 by Amir Eitny, the founder of [Reyna Network](/what-is-reyna/), before the project's launch in 2021. It's worth noting that Reyna Network, like many community-driven, open-source software projects, has evolved since its initial inception._

_Although we are just getting started, we maintain this paper because it continues to serve as a useful reference and an accurate representation of Reyna Network and its vision. To learn about the latest developments of Reyna Network, and how changes to the protocol are made, we recommend [this guide](/learn/)._

## Executive Summary {#executive-summary}

Reyna Network is an open source messaging platform, cryprocurrency exchange and mobile interface to interact with decentralized applications that run on the [Binance Smart Chain](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/an-introduction-to-binance-smart-chain-bsc).

This document presents a utility network token for Reyna Network, the first ever mobile Binance Smart Chain client built entirely on peer-to-peer technologies.

The messenger form-factor is chosen to make Binance Smart Chain feel as familiar as possible to the average smartphone user, while providing a flexible platform for DApp developers, aimed to maximise the amount of daily use of Binance Smart Chain’s public blockchain.

The RNT token is a modular utility token that fuels the Reyna Network. This includes a Decentralized Push Notification Market, Governance of the reyna client, Community Curation of content, along with social communication tools such as Tribute to Talk. We also propose a fiat-to-crypto 'Network Incentivization', DApp Directory, Sticker Market (NFT), and demonstrate our research on a User Acquisition Engine to grow the Network.

The Reyna Network Token (‘RNT’) will be distributed at a rate of 5,000 RNT per 1 BNB to participants in the Contribution Period, and is expected to begin on June 14th. The Contribution Period will run for 14 days, or within 24 hours of the first ceiling of 5M USD (United States Dollar) having been reached.

## Background {#background}

1.  40.8% of internet traffic in 2020 was not human
2.  Bad bot traffic increased 6.2% and now represents more than one quarter of all website requests
3.  Bots disguised as mobile browser users rose to 28.1%, up from 12.9% in 2019

SAN MATEO, Calif., April 13, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [Imperva, Inc.](https://www.imperva.com/), ([@Imperva](https://twitter.com/Imperva)) the cybersecurity leader whose mission is to protect data and all paths to it, releases the Imperva Bad Bot Report 2021, the eighth annual global in-depth analysis of bot traffic across every industry. In 2020, Imperva Research Labs saw the highest percentage of bad bot traffic (25.6%) since the inception of the report in 2014, while traffic from humans fell by 5.7%. More than 40% of all web traffic requests originated from a bot last year, suggesting the growing scale and widespread impact of bots in daily life.

Advanced Persistent Bots remained the majority of bad bot traffic last year, amounting to 57.1%. These bots are responsible for high-speed abuse, misuse and attacks on websites, mobile apps and APIs. They closely mimic human behavior and are harder to detect and stop, presenting a unique challenge for organizations that want to mitigate downtime, reduce bandwidth consumption and improve experiences for legitimate human customers. In addition, this breed of bots creates havoc for organizations through price scraping, content scraping, account creation, account takeover, fraud, denial of service and denial of inventory.

In 2020, telecom and internet service providers (ISPs) experienced the highest proportion of overall bot traffic (45.7%), often the result of bots involved in account takeover or competitive price scraping. Meanwhile, the travel industry saw the greatest percentage of sophisticated bad bot traffic (59.7%) while government sites also experienced an increase, with bots involved in account takeover, data scraping of business registration listings and voter registration.

“As we’ve monitored over the past eight years, bad bots continue to ravage the Internet, while attack characteristics are becoming more advanced and nuanced over time,” says Edward Roberts, Director of Strategy, Application Security, Imperva. “Throughout the past year and during a global pandemic, bad bots have thrived by targeting new markets and the impacts are now felt by everyday consumers. The Grinch Bot disruption to the gaming hardware industry in late 2020 is one example of what happens when bots go unchecked and cause denial of inventory. Bad bots must be a top concern for businesses and security practitioners in 2021 as the problem is likely to grow. Organizations must take proactive action to secure their websites, applications and APIs from these threats as bots are increasingly involved in fraudulent activity that can be a source of reputational and financial damage.”

The problem of social bots and media manipulation serves as a catalyst in re-evaluating how we design our social networks and is just one symptom that is systemic in the user-asproduct business model. In this paper we will present our ideas for the next generation social network, the socio-economic network.

Amir and Dani, the co-founders of Reyna Network, have had a working relationship for 5 years on various projects, and 3 of those years were spent operating a software distribution network, driving over 10 million installs to various software oferings, the profits of which were used to fund Reyna Network and our team of 15 until this point. During the operation of this business we were uniquely positioned to see firsthand how personal data on the internet is bought and sold and how users are acquired and retained.

## Legacy Social Networks {#legacy-social-networks}

Everyone-as-a-stakeholder

Social networks today consist of three parties: the owner, the advertiser, and the user. Each party serves a role that sustains the growth and development of the platform. Despite each playing a critical function, these parties operate with vastly diferent goals in mind and current models fail to provide a means by which their incentives can coexist and be aligned.

### The Owner {#the-owner}

The owning entity is typically the creator of the network. Their role is to attract and retain users to their platform. Their goal has historically been to create a walled garden around a user base and extract value from it. They rely on algorithms to keep the user engaged with the platform, but do not necessarily operate with the interest of the user in mind. The Owner’s priority is value extraction from the user, followed by user retention.

The argument for the aforementioned incentive mechanism, is that by presenting the user with more relevant advertisements that the user wants will ultimately lead to more value creation. However, this is not always the case. The owner can instead use the data collected on users to do the inverse and intentionally elicit consumer behaviours or sway public opinion. Facebook has published non-consensual social experiments that have demonstrated that by manipulating the information the user consumed while engaged with the network, they could efectively manipulate what that user thinks, feels, and believes ([Kramer et al.l 2014](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full)).

To make this point more concrete, consider how a beauty product might actually convert better, given that users insecurities could be made more severe via a small change in the networks content ranking system, and ultimately drive their purchasing action.

### The Advertiser {#the-advertiser}

The Advertiser, or Data Broker, enables the Owner to extract value from the network, ultimately sustaining the platform. This is done by purchasing the user’s data, purchasing qualified leads to their products or services, or by purchasing targeted advertising inventory based on user profiling performed by the Network Owner.

### The Users {#the-users}

The user’s perspective in the network is quite diferent. Often users do not approach these networks with the explicit intention of buying products, but rather to connect with friends and loved ones or to reach communities who share their own special interests. Often they are powerless to control the information they consume, or how the network is developed. They have no choice but rely on the Owners and Advertisers to behave ethically, or stop using the network entirely.

## Socio-economic Networks {#socio-economic-networks}

What if we could flatten these roles? What if users of social networks possessed a real stake in the networks they participate in? What if we could align incentives for all parties and create a network that naturally promotes behaviours that benefit all participants?

With the issuance of the the Reyna Network Token ('RNT'), we create a Users-as-Stakeholders network, allowing the behaviour of the network and its software, to become aligned with the interests of its Users.

The Reyna Network Token is required for certain features of the client. In addition, it enables users to steer the direction of development and influence how the network evolves over time. A benefit of this model is the network efects it creates. Just as Facebook shifted our social attention to build network efects on its closed platform, the Reyna Network Token will leverage our economic attention to build the network efect of an open platform.

We believe that cryptoeconomic systems will have even stronger pull than the social ones. Our survival instincts, which heavily influence our economic interests, are stronger than purely social ones, thus leading to faster adoption of Binance Smart Chain and tokens as technologies.

## Why Binance Smart Chain {#why-binance-smart-chain}

The launch of BSC, an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible blockchain that is ready to be tested and piloted by some of the top projects in the crypto industry, is expected to greatly increase the utility of both Binance Chain and BNB. With the introduction of the Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism, BSC creates an ecosystem where validators, token holders, developers, and users all benefit from a rewarding blockchain that offers high performance and ample space for further innovations.

The Binance Chain community launched BSC in time for the DeFi (decentralized finance) revolution, as the public shows increased interest in alternative financial solutions powered by blockchain. With BSC’s launch, DeFi projects and the bigger blockchain community can leverage the best that Binance Chain has to offer, fortified by smart contract support, cross-chain interoperability, and more advantages that BSC brings. So the Binance Chain and Smart Chain community welcome all the dApp developers and projects to try on this new arena.

### What’s In It For Users {#whats-in-it-for-users}

To blockchain users, you are welcome to a new decentralized machine with many valuable assets brought in by Binance Chain and Binance.com.

Some of the benefits of Binance Smart Chain include:

1. A rich and growing digital asset ecosystem powered by Binance DEX, the leading decentralized exchange.
2. Cheap transaction fees that reach as low as 1 cent.
3. High performance with a network capable of producing a block every 3 seconds.
4. Cross-chain DeFi mechanisms that increase DeFi interoperability.
5. A supportive Binance ecosystem that funds and bootstraps many DeFi projects.
6. A growing ecosystem of millions of users across Binance.com and Binance DEX.
7. A network of major crypto projects already collaborating with BSC.

Binance Smart Chain communities are wrapping up to release many handy tools this month, for functions such as token issuance and transfer, BNB staking, and dApp creation and usage.

### A Growing Network of BUIDLers {#a-growing-network-of-buidlers}

Even before the mainnet launch of Binance Smart Chain, numerous crypto projects are already working with the Binance Chain community to help make BSC a robust blockchain platform.

Here are some of our collaborators:

- **Blockchain Infrastructure and Tools**: ChainLink, Band Protocol, Trust Wallet, Ankr, BSCScan, Bitquery.io, MathWallet, MyWish, CertiK, Torus.

- **DeFi**: Swipe, Aave, 1inch.exchange, WazirX, DODO, dForce, Bounce.finance, Spartan Protocol, MCDEX, Cream, ForTube, DeBank.

- **Cross-Chain Liquidity**: RenVM, pNetwork, Thorchain, Ferrum.Network, Alpha Finance.

- **Others**: Dapp.Review, Ontology, Travala.com, Republic.co, Clutch, BCA, Ignite.

## The reyna Mobile Client {#the-reyna-mobile-client}

To introduce the next part of the infrastructure we need to work back from people, we need
to understand how they interact with technology and how they live their daily lives.

Smartphones are the new personal computer and are increasingly the access point to the
digital world for citizens of both developing and developed nations alike. As of 2014,
smartphone usage surpassed desktop usage and continues to trend upwards
([Comscore 2016](https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2016/2016-US-Cross-Platform-Future-in-Focus)).

Amongst the growing populations with access to smartphones and mobile internet,
messengers have become the primary means of digital communication, and are poised to
surface as the new gatekeepers to economic trade.

Messengers as an application category now boast more users than web 2.0 social networks ([BI Intelligence 2015](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-messaging-app-report-2015-11)), the highest retention rates ([Flurry 2015](https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Messaging-Apps-Overindex-Retention/1012289)), and are where smartphone users are spending an increasing amount of their time.

In China, WeChat now boasts 889m active users with 90%+ penetration rates in China's largest cities. WeChat Pay is also now used by 93% of WeChat users for ofline purchases in China's largest cities ([Penguin Intelligence 2017](https://chinachannel.co/1017-wechat-report-users/), [CNTechInsights 2017](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5d6Th5wndmJT25cRHemZNg)). On average WeChat users spend 66 minutes per day within the application. WeChat has become tightly integrated into all aspects of daily life in China. One can arrange social life, banking, business activities, transport and payments directly from within it. However, WeChat is a closedsource, proprietary interface, and its centralized architecture leaves it open to coercion and corruption.

The trend towards messaging-as-a-platform epitomized by WeChat has not yet reached most of the West or the developing world. reyna aims to be the first messaging platform to achieve this, using a decentralized and community governed approach.

Utilizing the messaging-as-a-platform user experience, Reyna Network mobile client presents a familiar feel that’s convenient and well suited for mass adoption. reyna respects the Users rights by being open source and free, and unlike its centralized counterparts, it puts users in complete control of their own personal data. Reyna Network acts as a node that connects directly to the Binance Smart Chain, adhering to our guiding principles of fair and permissionless access, decentralization and trustlessness.

reyna is an open source messaging platform and web 3.0 browser, designed to interact with decentralized applications that run on the Binance Smart Chain. Built using decentralized technologies, Reyna Network provides a window into the emerging decentralized web. As an ecosystem of decentralized applications, reyna becomes a gateway to undeniable free trade, peer-to-peer payments, and encrypted p2p communication for anyone with a smartphone and internet access.

reyna and Binance Smart Chain provide the foundation necessary to give all stakeholders in a socioeconomic network equal footing. The reyna application, which is currently in alpha, and available for Android & iOS, allows users to:

1.  Send and receive encrypted messages, smart contracts, and payments.
2.  Browse, chat, and interact with decentralized applications and decentralized chatbots.
3.  Store and control crypto-assets with the built-in reyna Wallet.

By introducing the Reyna Network Token, we can not only provide use-cases that were previously impossible in web 2.0 environments, but also address some of the core problems created by incentive misalignment and sock puppet bot creation that plague social networks today.

This begins at a Governance level, by empowering stakeholders in the Reyna Network; giving them a real voice and ability to influence the direction of the software as it develops.

## Decentralized Push Notification Market {#decentralized-push-notification-market}

Taking a hard stance on decentralization in the client isn’t without its challenges. Due to the peer-to-peer nature of the Binance Smart Chain communication subprotocol, Whisper (SHH), simple expected user experiences, such as being notified when a friend has responded to your messages, have to be themselves redesigned in a decentralized context.

With the new Whisper V2 protocol, we can now delegate nodes to do ofline inboxing (storing messages while clients are ofline) and we will extend this ability to support push notifications.

This allows us to establish a market for push notification providers. For service, stakeholders will deposit RNT with a provider, who may charge microtransactions for notification and storage.

This afords stakeholders the right to choose which nodes in the network will provide the service for them, and what kind of push notification providers they would like to use, perhaps choosing Deepstream over Google or opting completely out of the service to maximize their privacy.

We recognize that in a model where the User is no longer the Product, paying for push notifications may initially seem like a hurdle, as Users in existing platforms currently get this ‘for free’. Instead we make the costs explicit to the User and don’t exclude possibilities where a push notification node could build a business on top of the infrastructure, ie. ofer the service ‘for free’ by the User viewing ads to pay for push notifications. The end result is that we give the User a choice.

reyna implements an application protocol for message re-delivery, so as soon as both parties are online in the network, messages are exchanged and history is updated.

### RNT Utility {#rnt-utility}

- RNT is required by Stakeholders to select and receive push notifications.

### Example use-cases {#example-use-cases}

- Stakeholder A, a casual user, wants to receive Push Notifications and pays a microtransaction in RNT to do so.
- Stakeholder B, an early adopter in Cuba, has been paying for Push Notifications, but Google’s Firebase has just been blocked in his country. He seamlessly changes to a diferent provider from with within reyna.
- Stakeholder C, a Push Notification provider, wants to generate RNT, so they participate in the market to ofer their services.

## Governance {#governance}

One major drawback in legacy social networks is the lack of influence their users possess over the networks themselves. They are often powerless in having a say on how the platform evolves. We aim to democratise this power, giving stakeholders a direct influence over all decisions within the network, including how the software is developed.

A core part of the Reyna Network Token is giving stakeholders the ability to choose the direction that the software is developed. The token is used to make decisions on proposals, which can be made by any Stakeholder. For each decision, the token is cloned into a separate decision token. The amount of tokens you hold at that time becomes your voting power for that decision and it does not cost RNT to vote.

Initially, key decisions will be put towards software development. We have already created a Github Bounty Bot, which allows us to decentralize and incentivise open source software development, by enabling anyone to create bounties for any Github Issue. These can then be paid to the developer upon submitting code that is successfully merged into the codebase by the Project Maintainer.

Decentralizing additional components of reyna' governance needs to happen over time, given the sheer complexity of the task. We have been closely monitoring the progress of decentralized governance projects in the space including [Aragon](https://aragon.org/), [Boardroom](https://www.boardroom.info/), and [Colony](https://colony.io/).

## Usernames on reyna Name Service {#usernames-on-reyna-rame-service}

By default reyna is free to use and communicate with. You are identified by a [SECP256k1](https://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf) public key. Since the Eitny Foundation’s reyna Name Service is specifically designed to map string to DApps and addresses, it is a natural fit for Whisper-based identities. We are working with Nick Johnson, co-creator of the Ehereum Name Service, to create a usernameto-SECP256k1 public key resolver on ENS that allows stakeholders to register usernames on a first-in, first-out basis, with a social recovery mechanism. This gives stakeholders a humanreadable and recoverable access point should phone or private keys be lost.

Rather than delegating other addresses to recover, we instead abstract the recovery process by allowing the stakeholder to create 5 signed messages, that can then be shared out-ofband with friends or stored in a safe location. A default of 3 of 5 signed messages will be required to change the username owner, but can be optionally changed by the stakeholder.

An account must be holding The Reyna Network Token in order to reserve a username. This username is used to identify themselves within the greater reyna community, and signal participation in the network. Should a stakeholder wish to leave the network they can withdraw their tokens and the username will be unreserved and claimable by any other stakeholder.

This system will then depend on uPort for KYC/AML requirements where required, as a completely optional step, for users who wish to interact with regulated financial tools and DApps within the application.

### RNT Utility {#rnt-utility}

- RNT is required to register a username on the Reyna Network.

### Example use-cases {#example-use-cases}

- Stakeholder A, a casual user, wishes to register the username @david inside of reyna so his friends can easily find him, and more easily recover his account should he lose his mobile device.
- Stakeholder B, a DApp developer, mandates only registered reyna users to post on his discussion board DApp, in order to mitigate sockpuppet accounts using his decentralized application and increase the quality of content.

## Indicators of Trust {#indicators-of-trust}

In many social networks, Platform Owners ofer attestations on User accounts to signal that their account is reputable. Often this requires revealing government issued documents and is represented as a simple badge that says “verified account”.

With the Reyna Network Token, we intend to implement a non-exploitable online reputation system based on TrustDavis ([DeFigueiredo and Barr 2005](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~defigued/index_files/trustdavis.pdf), [DeFigueiredo and Barr 2009](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~defigued/index_files/beholder.pdf)). Stakeholders can deposit RNT against usernames at a premium, creating a badge indicating a level of value that username holds and the amount of backers they have.

This will allow us to establish a base Web of Trust, which will give an indication of how reputable a username is within the network and this can be further developed in the future, for example, with the integration of Trustlines.

This value may be used as insurance in escrow based transactions on Binance Smart Chain, in the Reyna Network Incentivization or wherever reputation can be put at stake.

This sets the foundation for moderation tools in Public Group Chats, enabling users to create environments for communication based upon economic stake in a digital asset or token.

In this model, reyna users have to prove they have a minimum economic stake in a token, or set of tokens, in order to qualify as a participant to join the online discussion, thus significantly raising the costs of sockpuppet actors. There will be a micro-deposit in RNT required for creating a group chat with these moderation tools.

### RNT Utility {#rnt-utility}

- RNT is required to deploy a semi-public token-based group chats.

### Example use-cases {#example-use-cases}

- Stakeholder A, an asset manager, wishes to create a community of other reyna users, who each hold a minimum of 10 BNB, [Binance Coin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/binance-coin-bnb.asp), to discuss the future of the project.
- Stakeholder B, an economist, wishes to create a group discussion where users have to hold both BNB, [Binance Coin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/binance-coin-bnb.asp), and CAKE, [PancakeSwap Token](https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/what-is-pancakeswap) so he can have an educated discussion about stable coins.
- Stakeholder C, an event organizer, has issued a [Nonfungible tokens](https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq) as a ticket for a music festival inside of reyna, and allows attendees to join a Public Group Chat.

## Tribute to Talk {#tribute-to-talk}

Inspired by one of Satoshi Nakamoto’s original suggested use cases for Bitcoin, we will be introducing an economics-based anti-spam filter, in our case for receiving messages and “cold” contact requests from users.

This enables stakeholders to set a minimum amount of RNT that a reyna stakeholder must deposit in order for someone outside of their network to contact him directly. If the recipient replies the deposit is forfeited to the recipient.

### RNT Utility {#rnt-utility}

- RNT is deposited, and transferred from stakeholders to recipients upon receiving a reply from the recipient.

### Example use-cases {#example-use-cases}

- Stakeholder A, a professional, would like to reach out to a high profile figure in the same industry, but would otherwise have no means of receiving a response.
- Stakeholder B, an artist and celebrity wishes to spend some time chatting with fans, and also desires a means of monetizing their fan base.
- Stakeholder C, a freelancer, provides photography tutorials, and has a means of generating revenue.

## Community Curation & Attention-based Signalling {#community-curation-and-attention-based-signalling}

In legacy social networks, ranking of information is typically done by the platform owner, often with the intent of driving up profits. In this model, content discovery algorithms are opaque, prone to censorship, monopolistic in nature, and possess high switching costs should users of the network become dissatisfied with the quality of content discovery.

Within the Reyna Network, stakeholders will be able to opt-in to curate the content that is displayed by producing signatures on events (i.e. by upvoting or downvoting content or ideas), referred to as signals, in which the stakeholders’ token backing is weighted in ranking.

The aggregate signals generated from stakeholders form an open graph that content rankers can use. Should a stakeholder be dissatisfied with the content ranking by their current provider, they can choose between a market of search algorithm providers, keeping algorithm providers honest and removing the monopoly web 2.0 solutions have on the way we consume information.

### RNT Utility {#rnt-utility}

- RNT is required to opt-in for curation mechanisms.

### Example use-cases {#example-use-cases}

- Stakeholder A, an early adopter, has moderate stake in the network, and has an economic incentive to see the content ranking remain high, and opts in for Community Curation.
- Stakeholder B, a data scientist, believes he can improve upon a content algorithm and thus the value of the network, so purchases a larger stake in the Network and submits a new algorithm.

## reyna Incentivization Network {#reyna-incentivization-network}

One of the core hurdles to the adoption of cryptocurrency is the dificulty in obtaining it. Ease of access is necessary to transition our economies from fiat to digital currency.

In order to solve this problem, we propose the implementation of the reyna Incentivization Network, DApp inside of reyna, which provides borderless, peer-to-peer fiat-to-crypto ‘Network Incentivization’.

The Network Incentivization allows Stakeholders in the Network to find nearby users to exchange their cash for digital assets and currency, giving any smartphone owner in the world the ability to take control of their personal wealth.

In this sense, reyna becomes a piece of a “Web 3.0” banking infrastructure and creates a global people-as-ATM network. This has particular utility in developing markets where cashbased economies are prevalent and credit card penetration remains low, tackling the famous ‘last-mile’ of the remittance market.

The growing trade volumes observed on LocalBitcoins, ~30M USD per week ([CoinDance 2021](https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins)), coupled with the rise of remittance startups built on legacy systems like TransferWise ([Crunchbase 2021](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/transferwise#/)), serve as a testament to the viability of this model.

### RNT Utility {#rnt-utility}

- RNT is required to become a seller.
- Research case: RNT required for arbitration.

### Example use-cases {#example-use-cases}

- Stakeholder A, a street vendor in India, becomes a Seller on the reyna Incentivization Network as a means of generating additional revenue.
- Stakeholder B, a father in Argentina, is concerned with the volatility of the Argentine Peso, and finds a nearby Seller to purchase some Gold-backed tokens (DGX) to provide greater security for his family.
- Stakeholder C, a migrant worker in Thailand, is fed up with the high cost of remittance to send money back to her family in Myanmar, and both herself and her partner use the reyna Incentivization Network.

## DApp Directory {#dapp-directory}

While the Binance Smart Chain network is still in its infancy, the rate of decentralized applications on the platform is already growing drastically. The reyna DApp Directory provides a way for stakeholders in the network to discover the most useful DApps, as curated by other community members.

Much like the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, the reyna DApp directory will provide a way to navigate by category and rating, enabling users to find exactly what they are looking for.

### RNT Utility {#rnt-utility}

- Required for curation and signaling in the reyna Incentivization Network.
- Research case: Required as a deposit by DApp Developers who wish to attain greater attention to their DApp.

### Example use-cases {#example-use-cases}

- Stakeholder A, opts-in to send curation signals to improve the quality of the DApp Directory listings, these signals help improve the quality of content ranking.
- Research Case: Stakeholder B, a DApp developer, has launched a new decentralized application, and wants to receive more users and exposure.

## Sticker Market {#sticker-market}

Stickers ofer a fun way for users to visually interact with their friends and family, and have been shown to increase engagement levels within messaging apps, particularly among millennials. The messaging app Line for instance derives about a quarter of its yearly revenues from sticker sales, or about $268m USD ([Line Corporation IPO Filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1611820/000119312516618753/d728446df1.htm)).

We propose the implementation of a Sticker Market within reyna, allowing anyone to create and begin selling their own designs to users all over the world, and to begin using stickers within any reyna chat.

You can read about Simon de la Rouviere’s Meme Market Alpha Protocol paper that inspired this idea ([Rouviere 2017](https://github.com/simondlr/mememarkets)). The objective is the creation of a mechanism for the algorithmic minting of tokenized stickers, which aims to capture the natural interest in a sticker or meme propagating itself through the network at any given time.

### RNT Utility {#rnt-utility}

- Required for Curation & Signalling in the Sticker Market.
- Required by Sellers to participate in the Sticker Market.
- Required by Traders to participate in the Sticker Market.

### Example use-cases {#example-use-cases}

- Stakeholder A, a casual user, sends Stakeholder B a sticker as a birthday present. The
  sticker is backed by 5 DGX, representing 5 grams of gold.
- Stakeholder B, an artist, submits work to the reyna Sticker Market as a means of
  generating revenue.
- Stakeholder C, a trader, trades derivatives and futures on meme markets based on a
  trading algorithm that incorporates data inputs from current events.

## User Acquisition Engine {#user-acquisition-engine}

Achieving our mission ultimately requires one thing: widespread end-user adoption. Using the Reyna Network Token, we can design mechanisms for growth that have been tried and tested in Web 2.0, whilst providing greater transparency and better alignment of incentives for participants.

The reyna Acquisition Engine provides a cryptographically provable and transparent means of growing the user base. The reyna Acquisition Engine functions as a network level acquisition model and Lifetime Value (henceforth known as LTV) claims market, based on the reyna Team’s experience in user acquisition strategy. This is an area with many moving parts, so it remains a research topic and is subject to change.

The reyna Acquisition Engine is based on the referral design in the paid user acquisition business model. In this model an Advertiser asks a Publisher to drive trafic to their ofering, paying the Publisher on a cost-per-action basis (for example, a payout on install). While efective in driving large volumes of trafic, the Advertiser is left with the burden of verifying the integrity of the user acquisition whilst at the same time the Publisher has no immediate disincentives for providing low quality users. Additionally, the Advertiser often wants to drive free trafic to their ofering without fully considering the costs associated with unproductive users.

The Advertiser in this scenario is primarily interested in determining the LTV of an acquisition and therefore makes a risk-based assessment which can be refined by accurately predicting the LTV at time of acquisition.

During our operation of this business model we had the opportunity to participate as both Advertiser (henceforth known as Buyer) and Publisher (henceforth known as Seller), which helped us develop an intimate understanding of both perspectives.

It is our belief the incentive structures of this business model can be improved.

We aim to introduce a “Jellybean guessing contest” into the business model, where a Seller deposits the cost of an acquisition and bonded Predictors play to predict the LTV of a Candidate Address. We adapt the original model by:

1. Shifting the cost-per-action event from user acquisition to a deposit-backed Claim on an Acquisition, giving a Seller “skin in the game”.
2. Introducing a contest to determine the LTV of an Address.
3. Making it permissionless, requiring no prior agreement between Buyer and Seller.

This allows us to import future and past information into a single event for the Buyer to decide upon, in which he receives a Receipt on the candidate address that can be used as a claim on that Address. The Claims are yet to be defined but could include, for example, a claim on fee’s accrued in a Receipt-honouring DApp.

### RNT Utility {#rnt-utility}

- Required to become a Seller in the Acquisition Engine.
- Required to become a Buyer in the Acquisition Engine.
- Deposits are made in RNT.

### Example use-cases {#example-use-cases}

- Stakeholder A, owns a demand-side-platform (DSP), and sees an arbitrage opportunity to drive new stakeholders to the Network, and becomes a Seller. She downloads reyna’ media kit, and begins buying inventory, and has a real-time LTV calculation to instantly determine return on ad spend. She further increases personal stake in the Network, given the scarcity of RNT created by new members joining the network.
- Stakeholder B, a data analyst, wants to generate a side income, begins a Validator, and begins validating claims based on public data inputs.
- Stakeholder C, a mathematician, begins purchasing claims upon observing an arbitrage opportunity based on a public data set.

## Additional RNT Properties & Upgradability {#additional-rnt-properties-and-upgradability}

Based on the work of smart contract developer Dani Flores, the Reyna Network token possesses an interesting attribute - the ability to easily spawn new tokens that have the same balance distribution as the parent token at any given block number. We're strong believers in a culture of experimentation, and this model preserves fair contribution for early backers, without imposing rigid restrictions on the ability to test new RNT utility as the project evolves over time.

The core team and the reyna community are committed to ensuring that the RNT token adds value to the platform and drives network efects. Given the Binance Smart ecosystem is still in its infancy and token models are still being researched and developed, we also plan to introduce the ability to propose new functionality to the reyna community. Thus, RNT may be assigned a number of additional functions in the network beyond those defined in the scope above. Due to its complexity, future rights of the RNT are not guaranteed and remain a research topic.

## Development Progress {#development-progress}

The project initially started with a DEVGrant from the Eitny Foundation. With the exception of the initial Development Grant received from the Eitny Foundation - reyna has been entirely self-funded by the founders of the project.

Since then, reyna’ first public alpha was released in January 4th 2017 for Android & iOS. We have been operating on the Binance Testnet and our Alpha release has drawn over 300 Alpha testers, and another 300 are in queue for iOS Testflight.

Over the course of Q2 2021 - Q3 2021, we have introduced a user interface refresh and have been working on the stability of [bsc](https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc) on resource-restricted devices, and have developed out the base system for Whisper-based push notifications.

Moving into Q3 2021 we aim to start DApp development and begin security audits of the software. Developers are encouraged to review our Github repositories for more detailed information ([front-end](https://github.com/reynanetwork/front-end), [back-end](https://github.com/reynanetwork/back-end)).

## Contribution Period Details {#contribution-period-details}

The launch of the Reyna Network, and the corresponding token creation process, are organized around smart contracts running on Binance Smart Chain.

- The Contribution Period will begin June 14th, 2021. Instructions on how Contributors can participate will be made available closer to the date of the event.
- Participants willing to contribute to and support the development of the Reyna Network can do so by sending BNB to the designated address. By doing so contributors create Reyna Network Tokens (RNT) at the rate of 5,000 RNT per BNB.
- The RNT creation rate per BNB is fixed, and will remain constant for the duration of the Contribution Period.
- The number of RNT created depends on the amount of contributions received by the smart contract.
- The Contribution Period will run for a period of 14 days, or within 24 hours of reaching the first ceiling, of 5M USD (United States Dollar) equivalent in BNB, having been reached.
- reyna Research & Development Ltd. controls the contract and the address to which gathered BNB will be sent (implemented as a multisig address).
- RNT received by Contributors will be transferrable 7 days after the end of the
  Contribution Period.

### Team Tokens {team-tokens}

Team tokens are initially locked in the Governance smart contract and can be used by the team to initiate and vote even in a locked state. These tokens will be unlocked with the growth of the trading volume in the reyna ecosystem, and as TVL grows in the decentralized reyna ecosystem. This will allow the team to be as much motivated in the development of the platform as possible and have the desire to increase the trading volume and the growth of locked funds in the reyna ecosystem.

### Base Pool {base-pool}

Tokens allocated for liquidity will initially be placed in the Base Pool. They can be bought at any time by accredited market makers at the current fixed price with a small discount. Within a certain period, they can return these tokens back to the Base Pool at the same price. This will create additional arbitrage opportunities for users and arbitrage bots as well as solve the problem with a potential liquidity crisis.

A liquidity crisis is a situation in which there are significantly fewer token sellers than buyers and the price begins to rapidly grow inorganically, generating a kind of pump. Due to the Base Pool system, such crises will be mitigated. This would generally keep the reyna ecosystem in a healthier economic state.

### Reserve Tokens {reserve-tokens}

Reserve tokens are intended for activities that will be initiated in the future. Also, with the help of this reserve fund, some risks can be mitigated if they arise.

This reserve fund is managed through a Governance contract by voting. Therefore, holders of RNT tokens can put forward proposals and vote for this or that decision when it is necessary to use these tokens.

### Farming Tokens {farming-tokens}

Liquidity providers (users who provide liquidity to the pools on decentralized exchanges) can supply liquidity to DEX reynaSwap pools and accredited third-party pools (like Pancake Swap), and get rewards in RNT tokens as part of a profitable farming platform.

The user who has placed liquidity needs to stake the LP tokens received in the pool (liquidity tokens) in the farming smart contract.

### Tokens Allocated for Rewards {tokens-allocated-for-rewards}

The users performing useful activities for the ecosystem will be rewarded with the RNT tokens. Useful activities include trades on DEX and CEX, referral activity, participation in voting, contests and special events, staking and earning programs, and other activities in the ecosystem.
