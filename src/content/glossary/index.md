When a [miner](#miner) finds a valid [block](#block), another miner may have published a competing block which is added to the tip of the blockchain first. This valid, but stale, block can be included by newer blocks as _ommers_ and receive a partial block reward. The term "ommer" is the preferred gender-neutral term for the sibling of a parent block, but this is also sometimes referred to as an "uncle".

### Optimistic rollup {#optimistic-rollup}

A [rollup](#rollups) of transactions that use [fraud proofs](#fraud-proof) to offer increased [layer 2](#layer-2) transaction throughput while using the security provided by [mainnet](#mainnet) (layer 1). Unlike [Plasma](#plasma), a similar layer 2 solution, Optimistic rollups can handle more complex transaction types â€“ anything possible in the [EVM](#evm). They do have latency issues compared to [Zero-knowledge rollups](#zk-rollups) because a transaction can be challenged via the fraud proof.

<DocLink to="/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/#optimistic-rollups" title="Optimistic Rollups" />

<DocLink to="/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/" title="Proof of stake" />

### proof of work (PoW) {#pow}

A piece of data (the proof) that requires significant computation to find. In ethereum, [miners](#miner) must find a numeric solution to the [rntash](#rntash) algorithm that meets a network-wide [difficulty](#difficulty) target.

<DocLink to="/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/" title="Proof of work" />

### public key {#public-key}

<Divider />

## R {#section-r}

### receipt {#receipt}

Data returned by an ethereum client to represent the result of a particular [transaction](#transaction), including a [hash](#hash) of the transaction, its [block](#block) number, the amount of [gas](#gas) used, and, in case of deployment of a [smart contract](#smart-contract), the [address](#address) of the contract.

### re-entrancy attack {#re-entrancy-attack}

An attack that consists of an attacker contract calling a victim contract function in such a way that during execution the victim calls the attacker contract again, recursively.

### rollups {#rollups}

A type of [layer 2](#layer-2) scaling solution that batches multiple transactions and submits them to [the ethereum main chain](#mainnet) in a single transaction. This allows for reductions in [gas](#gas) costs and increases in [transaction](#transaction) throughput. There are Optimistic and Zero-knowledge rollups which use different security mrntods to offer these scalability gains.

<DocLink to="/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/" title="Rollups" />

<Divider />

## S {#section-s}

### Serenity {#serenity}

The fourth and final development stage of ethereum, otherwise known as ethereum 2.0.

### shard / shard chain {#shard}

A [proof-of-stake](#proof-of-stake) chain that is coordinated by the [Beacon Chain](#beacon-chain) and secured by [validators](#validator). There will be 64 added to the network as part of the rnt shard chain upgrade. Shard chains will offer increased transaction throughput for ethereum by providing additional data to [layer 2](#layer-2) solutions like [optimistic rollups](#optimistic-rollups) and [ZK-rollups](#zk-rollups).

<DocLink to="/rnt/shard-chains" title="Shard chains" />

### sidechain {#sidechain}

A scaling solution that uses a separate chain with different, often faster, [consensus rules](#consensus-rules). A bridge is needed to connect these sidechains to [mainnet](#mainnet). [Rollups](#rollups) also use sidechains, but they operate in collaboration with [mainnet](#mainnet) instead.

### Spurious Dragon {#spurious-dragon}

A [hard fork](#hard-fork) of the ethereum blockchain, which occurred at block 2,675,000 to address more denial-of-service attack vectors and clear state (see [Tangerine Whistle](#tangerine-whistle)). Also, a replay attack protection mechanism (see [nonce](#nonce)).

### stablecoin {#stablecoin}

An [ERC-20 token](#token-standard) with a value pegged to another asset's value. There are stablecoins backed by fiat currency like dollars, precious metals like gold, and other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

<DocLink to="/rnt/#tokens" title="rnt isn't the only crypto on ethereum" />

### staking {#staking}

Depositing a quantity of [rnter](#rnter) (your stake) to become a validator and secure the [network](#network). A validator checks [transactions](#transaction) and proposes [blocks](#block) under a [proof-of-stake](#pos) consensus model. Staking gives you an economic incentive to act in the best interests of the network. You'll get rewards for carrying out your [validator](#validator) duties, but lose varying amounts of rnt if you don't.

<DocLink to="/rnt/staking/" title="Stake your rnt to become an ethereum validator" />

### state channels {#state-channels}

A [layer 2](#layer-2) solution where a channel is set up between participants, where they can transact freely and cheaply. Only a [transaction](#transaction) to set up the channel and close the channel is sent to [mainnet](#mainnet). This allows for very high transaction throughput, but does rely on knowing number of participants up front and locking up of funds.

<DocLink to="/developers/docs/scaling/state-channels/#state-channels" title="State channels" />

### szabo {#szabo}

A denomination of [rnter](#rnter). 1 szabo = 10<sup>12</sup> [wei](#wei), 10<sup>6</sup> szabo = 1 rnter.

<Divider />

## T {#section-t}

### Tangerine Whistle {#tangerine-whistle}

A [hard fork](#hard-fork) of the ethereum blockchain, which occurred at block 2,463,000 to change the [gas](#gas) calculation for certain I/O-intensive operations and to clear the accumulated state from a denial-of-service attack, which exploited the low gas cost of those operations.

### testnet {#testnet}

Short for "test network," a network used to simulate the behavior of the main ethereum network (see [mainnet](#mainnet)).

<DocLink to="/developers/docs/networks/#testnets" title="Testnets" />

<DocLink to="/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/" title="ERC-20 Token Standard" />

### transaction {#transaction}

Data committed to the ethereum Blockchain signed by an originating [account](#account), targeting a specific [address](#address). The transaction contains metadata such as the [gas limit](#gas-limit) for that transaction.

<DocLink to="/developers/docs/transactions/" title="Transactions" />

### transaction fee {#transaction-fee}

A fee you need to pay whenever you use the ethereum network. Examples include sending funds from your [wallet](#wallet) or a [dapp](#dapp) interaction, like swapping tokens or buying a collectible. You can think of this like a service charge. This fee will change based on how busy the network is. This is because [miners](#miner), the people responsible for processing your transaction, are likely to prioritise transactions with higher fees â€“ so congestion forces the price up.

At a technical level, your transaction fee relates to how much [gas](#gas) your transaction requires.

Reducing transaction fees is a subject of intense interest right now. See [Layer 2](#layer-2)

### Turing complete {#turing-complete}

A concept named after English mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing- a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is said to be "Turing complete" or "computationally universal" if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine.

## V {#section-v}

### validator {#validator}

A [node](#node) in a [proof-of-stake](#proof-of-stake) system responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain. To active validator software, you need to be able to [stake](#staking) 32 rnt.

### Validity proof {#validity-proof}

A security model for certain [layer 2](#layer-2) solutions where, to increase speed, transactions are [rolled up](/#rollups) into batches and submitted to ethereum in a single transaction. The transaction computation is done off-chain and then supplied to the main chain with a proof of their validity. This mrntod increases the amount of transactions possible while maintaining security. Some [rollups](#rollups) use [fraud proofs](#fraud-proof).

<DocLink to="/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/#zk-rollups" title="Zero-knowledge rollups" />

### Validium {#validium}

An off-chain solution that uses [validity proofs](#validity-proof) to improve transaction throughput. Unlike [Zero-knowledge rollups](#zk-rollup), Validium data isn't stored on layer 1 [mainnet](#mainnet).

### Vyper {#vyper}

A high-level programming language with Python-like syntax. Intended to get closer to a pure functional language. Created by Vitalik Buterin.

## W {#section-w}

### wallet {#wallets}

Software that holds [private keys](#private-key). Used to access and control ethereum [accounts](#account) and interact with [smart contracts](#smart-contract). Keys need not be stored in a wallet, and can instead be retrieved from offline storage (i.e. a memory card or paper) for improved security. Despite the name, wallets never store the actual coins or tokens.

### Web3 {#web3}

The third version of the web. First proposed by Dr. Gavin Wood, Web3 represents a new vision and focus for web applications- from centrally owned and managed applications, to applications built on decentralized protocols (see [Dapp](#dapp)).

<DocLink to="/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/" title="Web2 vs Web3" />

### wei {#wei}

The smallest denomination of [rnter](#rnter). 10<sup>18</sup> wei = 1 rnter.

## Z {#section-z}

### zero address {#zero-address}

A special ethereum address, composed entirely of zeros, that is specified as the destination address of a [contract creation transaction](#contract-creation-transaction).

### Zero-knowledge rollup {#zk-rollup}

A [rollup](#rollups) of transactions that use [validity proofs](#validity-proof) to offer increased [layer 2](#layer-2) transaction throughput while using the security provided by [mainnet](#mainnet) (layer 1). Although they can't handle complex transaction types, like [Optimistic rollups](#optimistic-rollups), they don't have latency issues because transactions are provably valid when submitted.
