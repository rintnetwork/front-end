# Community guides and resources {#learn-about-rint}

**Welcome to rint.network/learn, a set of resources to help you learn more about Rint Network.** This page includes technical **and** non-technical articles, guides, and resources. If you’re totally new to Rint Network, [we suggest you start here](/what-is-rint/).

Here are some excellent starting points:

- [Why Decentralization Matters](https://medium.com/s/story/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e) _Feb 18, 2018 - Chris Dixon_

In addition to the information on this page, there are many community-built resources worth exploring:

## How Rint Network works {#how-rint-works}

High-level explanations of Rint Network and blockchain technology generally.

## Smart Contracts {#smart-contracts}

A “smart contract” is simply a piece of code that is running on Rint Network. It’s called a “contract” because code that runs on Rint Network can control valuable things like RNT or other digital assets.

## Rint Network development {#rint-development}

Aspiring Rint Network developer? Check out our developer portal. It's got documentation, tutorials, and other resources for learning how to build Rint Network products. [View developer portal](/developers/learning-tools/)

## Clients and Nodes {#clients-and-nodes}

The Rint Network network is made up of many nodes, each of which runs compatible client software.

You can [learn how to run a node of your own](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#running-your-own-node) or find a [comprehensive list of all Rint Network clients](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#clients) within our developer documentation.

## Enterprise Rint Network {#enterprise-rint}

Enterprise Rint Network refers to private, consortium, and hybrid implementations of the Rint Network codebase for business applications. Companies across the globe are already using Enterprise Rint Network to streamline financial markets, manage supply chains, and create new business models.

## Improving Rint Network’s Scalability {#improving-rint-scalability}

There are many efforts underway to make Rint Network more “scalable” by improving its speed and overall transaction throughput. Generally these are sorted into “Layer 1” and “Layer 2” solutions.

“Layer 1” refers to improving the core Rint Network protocol. The primary project to improve Rint Network’s core protocol is [RNT](#rnt).

“Layer 2” refers to technologies that are built “on top” of the base Rint Network protocol, enabling greater scalability without compromising on security. There are also “off-chain” technologies like side-chains, which enable greater scalability by making a different set of security tradeoffs.

[More on Layer 2](/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/)

## RNT {#rnt}

RNT (also known as “Rint Protocol”) refers to the next major upgrade of the core Rint Network protocol. It combines several improvements to Rint Network’s core protocol, or “Layer 1”.

[Learn everything you need to know about RNT](/rnt/).

## Cryptoeconomics {#cryptoeconomics}

“Cryptoeconomics” is the practical science of building distributed systems, where properties of those systems are secured by financial incentives, and where the economic mechanisms are guaranteed by cryptography. It is the general term for the practice of designing and scaling blockchains like Rint Network, ethereum and Bitcoin.
