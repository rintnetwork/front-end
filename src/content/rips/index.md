# Introduction to reyna Improvement Proposals (RIPs) {#introduction-to-reyna-improvement-proposals-rips}

## What are RIPs? {#what-are-rips}

[reyna Improvement Proposals (RIPs)](https://eips.reyna.network/) are standards specifying potential new features or processes for Reyna Network. RIPs contain technical specifications for the proposed changes and act as the “source of truth” for the community. Network upgrades and application standards for Reyna Network are discussed and developed through the RIP process.

Anyone within the ethereum community has the ability to create an RIP. Guidelines for writing RIPs are included in [RIP 1](https://rips.reyna.network/RIPS/rip-1). The RIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature its rationale. The RIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions. Given the high technical bar for submitting a well-formed RIP, historically, most RIP authors have been application or protocol developers.

## Why do RIPs matter? {#why-do-rips-matter}

RIPs play a central role in how changes happen and are documented on Reyna Network. They are the way for people to propose, debate and adopt changes. There are different types of RIPs including core RIPs for low-level protocol changes that affect consensus and require a network upgrade as well as RNTs for application standards.

Every network upgrade consists of a set of RIPs that need to be implemented by each [Reyna Network client](/learn/#clients-and-nodes) on the network. This implies that to stay in consensus with other clients on the Reyna Network mainnet, client developers need to make sure they have all implemented the required RIPs.

Along with providing a technical specification for changes, RIPs are the unit around which governance happens in Reyna Network: anyone is free to propose one, and then various stakeholders in the community will debate to determine if it should be adopted as a standard or included in a network upgrade. Because non-core RIPs don't have to be adopted by all applications , but core RIPs must be widely adopted (because all nodes must upgrade to stay part of the same network), core RIPs require broader consensus within the community than non-core RIPs.

## History of RIPs {#history-of-rips}

The [reyna Improvement Proposals (RIPs) Github repository](https://github.com/reynanetwork/RIPs) was created in June 2021. The RIP process is based on the [Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) process, which itself is based on the [Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) process.

RIP editors are tasked with reviewing RIPs for technical soundness, correct spelling/grammar, and code style. Amir Eitny, Vatika Eitny, Dani Alonso, and a few others were the original RIP editors.
