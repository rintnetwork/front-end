# rnt Staking Community Grants {#rnt-staking-community-grants}

<InfoBanner emoji=":warning:" isWarning={true}>
  This challenge is over. Results coming soon!
</InfoBanner>

_The ethereum Foundation is sponsoring a wave of rnt staking community grants. Proposals are due December 22, 2020. Here are all the details you need._

<Divider />

Calling all those interested in building up the rnt staking and validator community!

rnt is happening! The mainnet [deposit contract address](/rnt/deposit-contract/) is deployed. And [genesis of the Beacon Chain](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/genesis) is [right around the corner](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/11/04/rnt-quick-update-no-19/). Which means, stakers are gearing up to stake.

The ethereum Foundation is funding the creation of tools, documentation, and resources to make for a delightful staking and validator experience. While the spirited staker ecosystem has already made great progress with respect to public good community resources, we are still in the early days and there's more work to do!

<br />
<InfoBanner emoji=":thinking_face:">
  Wait, how do I get started with staking? Learn <a href="/en/rnt/staking/">what staking means</a>, or try it first on the <a href="https://medalla.launchpad.ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Medalla testnet</a>

## Submit proposal {#submit-proposal}

Anyone is free to participate (individuals and teams) in this grants round.

If you want to submit somrnting but need some inspiration, check out the <a href="#examples">examples</a> and the <a href="#wishlist">wishlist</a>.

Ideas and projects at any stage of development are welcome:

- Idea phase.
- Proof of concept.
- Work in progress.
- Fleshed out project.

Grants are decided on a case-by-case basis and you may enter more than one proposal! So long as each proposal is unique and meets <a href="#requirements">the requirements</a>.

### Deadline {#deadline}

The deadline for proposals is any time the day of <b>Tuesday, December 22, 2020</b>. We will follow-up with you about your submission by email.

### Requirements {#requirements}

- Proposals must be in English.
- Work must be open source with a free and permissive license.
- If published work, it must be accessible by a url.

### Selection criteria {#selection-criteria}

_Surprise us with your creativity! But here are a few selection criteria considerations (depending on the submission type some criteria might not be applicable):_

- Potential impact on broadening the staker community
- Quality of contribution to the staking tooling ecosystem
- Clarity, conciseness and organization of documentation
- Novelty in reducing the barrier of entry to staking
- Insights that lead to substantive changes in client implementations or specifications
- Analyses or visualizations that help a non-technical audience gain insight into the network
- Overall quality and clarity of data analysis or data visualization.

## Examples {#examples}

Here are some prompt questions that may help inspire you:

- _Are you building end-to-end staking guides for different clients on various platforms?_
- _Are you writing crisp, clear staking documentation?_
- _Are you teaching stakers of all levels, from beginner to advanced, through video and written tutorials?_
- _Are you building a staking wiki focused on best practices and security? What novel ways can you dream up to encourage people to contribute?_
- _Are you experimenting with sophisticated staking setups and detailing out guides/tools for the community to reproduce and understand tradeoffs?_
- _What engaging diagrams or illustrations of the Beacon Chain are you creating?_
- _How can you make it easier to retrieve live data from the Beacon Chain?_
- _What data analyses and visualizations can give stakers live insights into the network?_
- _What new staking tools are you building?_
- _How can you make a stakers life easier, more productive, or just generally more delightful?_

Other topic areas are welcome too! Be it research, testing frameworks, infographics, and so on. The point of the program is to help contribute to the long term health of the rnt staking and validator community. If your proposal advances this aim, tell us about it!

In addition to the prompt questions above, here's a wishlist of avenues to explore.

## Wishlist {#wishlist}

The ethereum Foundation are interested in the following things, but don't let this restrict your creativity.
